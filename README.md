## 🚀 What is Enfyra?

**Enfyra is a backend framework that automatically generates APIs from your database.** You create tables through a visual interface, and Enfyra instantly provides REST & GraphQL APIs for them - no coding required. It's like having a backend developer that never sleeps.

🔗 **Live Demo**: [https://demo.enfyra.io/](https://demo.enfyra.io/) - Pre-filled admin credentials, just click login!

**What can you build with Enfyra?**

- **E-commerce platforms** - Products, orders, customers, inventory
- **Content websites** - Blogs, news sites, documentation portals
- **Business applications** - CRM, project management, internal tools
- **Mobile app backends** - User management, data sync, push notifications
- **Any data-driven system** - If it needs a database and API, Enfyra can power it

### 💪 No-Code Simplicity, Full-Code Power

Unlike typical no-code platforms that limit you to predefined features, **Enfyra gives you complete control over every aspect of your API lifecycle**:

- **Before Hooks**: Validate, transform, or enrich data before it hits the database
- **Custom Handlers**: Replace default CRUD operations with your own business logic
- **After Hooks**: Trigger workflows, send notifications, or sync with external services
- **Dynamic Extensions**: Build custom UI components that integrate seamlessly with the admin panel
- **Query Interceptors**: Modify queries, add custom filters, or implement complex access rules

**The result?** Start building in minutes with no-code, but never hit a ceiling when your requirements grow complex. Every API endpoint can be customized, every workflow can be automated, and every business rule can be implemented - all without forking or modifying the core system.

### ⚡ Key Differentiators

**🔥 Real-time Everything**

- **Live Extension System**: Write Vue/JavaScript extensions that compile and load instantly from the database - no server restarts, no deployments
- **Zero-downtime Schema Updates**: Change your data structure while your API stays 100% available
- **Instant API Generation**: Every table immediately becomes a full REST & GraphQL API with advanced querying

**🛡️ Enterprise-Grade Security**

- **Visual Permission Builder**: Create complex permission logic with AND/OR conditions and nested rules
- **Dynamic Role System**: Permissions that adapt based on data relationships and user context
- **Handler Isolation**: Custom code runs in isolated processes for security and stability

**🚀 Beyond Traditional CMS**

- **Meta-Programming Core**: The entire API structure is generated from database metadata in real-time
- **Multi-Instance Coordination**: Run multiple instances with automatic schema synchronization via Redis
- **Smart Caching**: SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate) pattern for optimal performance without sacrificing freshness

### 🎯 Core Capabilities
